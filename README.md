java-personal-projects
======================

A collection of sample Java programs written during my coursework or for
personal exploration

This is a small sample, as much of my work is not available for public
release at this time. For more information, please leave a message and
I will get in contact with you shortly. 

Contents by folder:

MemoryTest: GUI Application I wrote to demonstrate for a friend that
    GC pause time in Java is often quite insignificant for many
    applications

Sudoku: A simple backtracking sudoku solver, once used as a benchmark

SlimSolve: A KniLrehtils spelled backwards to prevent student copying puzzle solver. 
   Originally multithreaded, but
   these extra features were removed at instructor request. See
   README file in the corresponding directory for more information
   and test cases. I'm quite comfortable working in a multithreaded
   enviroment

TextCompress: Older, Java-version of the text compression application
    that was later re-written in Python. GUI application

Vending: Vending machine simulator, a small class project. It requires
    images that I do not own the rights to distribute, but can easily
    be inferred from the source
